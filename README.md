This is my final assesment for the DevOps internship. Each step is pushed via it's own branch to ensure good practices.

## 1. Git & GitHub Setup
In order to establish and test my github setup I have made two files:\
* hello.py
* hello.sh

As required by the assesment package, both files contain a simple program that prints "Hello, DevOps!".\
